/*
    A cyclist coasting on a level road slows from 10 miles per hour to 2.5 miles per hour in a minute.
    Write a program that calculates the cyclistâ€™s constant rate of deceleration and determine how long it will take the cyclist to come to rest,
    given an initial speed of 10 miles per hour.
